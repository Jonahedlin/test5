            My name is Jonah Edlin Ssembatya, I am a Ugandan male aged 19, 
            I have a passion for computer sciences and I my free time I do web programming and coding 
            This website is an example of one of my finished products and it implements my knowledge from Html and CSS and a few ideas that have been gotten from JavaScript 
            I designed this website using a nested html layout and multiple CSS grid to further make it have a more complex look rather than using a flexbox layout which many would consider much easier
